**MS_Blackjack** is a program to predict organic substances ion peak formulas in mass spectrometry from exact or nominal mass, systematically sampling heuristically defined chemical spaces. Formulas are systematically generated within a space defined by a number of carbon and hydrogen atoms plausible for an organic molecule. This assumption can be broadened to include more chemical species (_extensive_ keyword) or completely removed to sample all possible combinatorial space (_wild_ keyword). It is possible to define which elements should make up the molecule (_only\_*_ keyword) and it is possible to manually input a molecular fragment as a starting guess for constructing the formula. The code can be interfaced with NIST mass spectral library (https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/form-ser/) to confront results with empirical spectra (_nist_ keyword).

**MS_Molecular_Ion_Split** is a script to generate a histogram of the pattern of a molecular ion in mass spectrometry, given its formula. Isotopic abundances are used to estimate ratios between different isotopes of ions and the emerging pattern can help to differentiate molecules.
